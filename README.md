# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-


Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that have gained significant popularity in recent years. GANs consist of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to create synthetic data that resembles the real data, while the discriminator's task is to distinguish between real and fake data.

The generator and discriminator are trained in an adversarial manner, where they compete against each other. The generator takes random noise as input and generates fake data samples, attempting to fool the discriminator into classifying them as real. The discriminator, on the other hand, is trained on a combination of real and fake data, aiming to correctly classify them. This back-and-forth process continues until both the generator and discriminator reach a point where they improve their performance.
